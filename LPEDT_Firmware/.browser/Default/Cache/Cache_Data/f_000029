For example, if you import a Zigbee application SLS project archive, and the imported project has link to a resource that actually resides in the project directory, and you try to edit the generated callbacks file in the project directory, you might encounter a problem where you're seeing an endless loop of \"copying file\" pop-up. This version temporarily works around the issue by stopping the copy process and closing the editor. You can work around the issue by doing the following:\n\t\t* Locate the project resource whose editing results in the bad behavior.\n\t\t* Make a copy of the file outside of the project and project directory.\n\t\t* Right-click on the resource and delete it. Confirm that you see a message that you're deleting a link and not the source of the link.\n\t\t* Right-click in the project explorer and select Refresh\n\t\t* At this point the resource should come back in the project and you'll be able to edit it.\n\n\t\tA permanent fix to the issue will be available in the next release.\n4.0.16\n\tImprove project import/export flows\n\tEnable project export flow in scripting mode\n4.0.15\n\tFix possible deadlock when opening an AppBuilder project from the launcher\n4.0.14\n\tFix file and project import not working on Linux installations\n4.0.13\n\tFix possible deadlock when loading multiple projects during startup\n\tImprove some factets of error reporting in the Error Log\n4.0.12\n\tImprovements to project export and import flows\n4.0.11\n\tGCC linker script generation improvements\n\tBetter integration with and support for App Builder generation\n4.0.10\n\tPackage signing\n4.0.9\n\tFixed bug where project regeneration was removing some optimization options\n\tFixed bug where exporting project to SLSPROJ was not honoring the \"Create Library\" setting\n\tFixed bug where some project setting change could invalidate the linker control file path\n\tFixed bug where Gecko SDK Suite update caused previously created project setting\n4.0.8\n\tAdd generated GBL file under 'binaries' virtual folder in project view\n\tImprove organization of software examples on Laucnher\n\tFix issue where Capacitive Sense Profiler does not display threshold values correctly with CSLIB on 'F99x' device\n4.0.7\n\tExtend infrastructure for possible future IDE support\n4.0.6\n\tFix issue reported on http://community.silabs.com/t5/Simplicity-Studio-and-Software/Zero-Gecko-DSP-compile-error/m-p/186748#M12753\n\tEliminate absolute paths in .cproject and .project files\n\tImprove the process of setting variables for new projects\n4.0.5\n\tSmall improvements to infrastructure\n4.0.3\n\tProject scripting rework\n4.0.2\n\tAPI Baseline adjustments\n4.0.1\n\tMinor improvements to headless operation\n4.0.0\n\tInitial release","installEnabled":true,"id":"com.silabs.ss.framework.ide.feature.metadata.resource.feature.group","label":"IDE Framework -

If those SDKs are not installed, the DMP sample applications are still presented as options. Attempting to create a DMP sample application may appear to complete, but subsequently will fail to generate because of unresolved dependencies on those SDKs. Subsequently installing those SDKs may not resolve the issues in that existing DMP sample application project.

If those SDKs are not installed, the DMP sample applications are still presented as options.
